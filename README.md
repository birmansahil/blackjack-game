# Blackjack Game

This project is a simple yet exciting Blackjack Game, which I developed to deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. The goal was to apply key concepts such as conditional statements, query selectors, arrays, random number generation, and more in a real-world scenario. Additionally, I focused on enhancing the game's user interface, adding some personal design touches to make it visually engaging.

## What I Learned

- Conditional statements: I used these extensively to manage the game flow, such as determining when a player has won, lost, or can continue playing.
- Query selectors: Helped me dynamically update the DOM to display cards, scores, and game status.
- Arrays and objects: I implemented these to store the deck of cards and track player data like the current hand and score.
- Math object: Utilized Math.random() to generate random card selections from the deck, making the game unpredictable and fun.
- Booleans, loops, and functions: Employed to manage game logic, including checking if the player should draw another card or if the game has ended.

## Challenges I Faced

- Managing the game state using conditional and logical operators was tricky, especially when determining win/loss conditions while keeping the logic clean and readable.
- Creating a smooth and interactive UI while balancing it with game logic.
- Working with functions and returns was an interesting challenge in maintaining modular, reusable code, especially when handling repetitive actions like drawing cards.

## Overall Review

This project helped me solidify a wide range of JavaScript concepts in a fun and engaging way. By combining essential programming constructs like conditional statements, loops, and objects with creative UI design, I was able to create a functional and enjoyable game. Building this Blackjack Game was a great experience, not only for practicing coding but also for learning how to manage user interaction and game logic in real time. It was a rewarding journey that pushed my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
